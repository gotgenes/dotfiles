description: Flag an observation for the session retrospective
---

The user wants to record a retrospective note. Add a todo item using the TodoWrite tool with the following conventions:

- **Content**: Prefix with `[retro]` followed by the user's observation: `[retro] $ARGUMENTS`
- **Status**: `pending` (must remain pending — the Retrospective agent will review it)
- **Priority**: `medium`

CRITICAL: First read the existing todo list, then write back ALL existing items plus the new `[retro]` item. The TodoWrite tool replaces the entire list — do not drop existing items.

Do not discuss or elaborate. Just add the todo item and briefly confirm what was recorded.
