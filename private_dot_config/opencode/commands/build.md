# Build

Implement the following.

$ARGUMENTS

Before starting:

1. If the arguments contain a file path (e.g., `docs/plans/foo.md`), read that file first — it is the implementation plan.
2. Read the project's AGENTS.md for conventions, commit message format, and relevant commands.
3. Create a Todo list from the plan's task list or acceptance criteria to track progress.

Begin implementation.
