Review the current session. Follow the procedure defined in your system prompt:

1. Summarize what was accomplished.
2. Identify observations — what went well, what caused friction.
3. Propose specific changes to AGENTS.md or agent definition files, ordered by impact.
4. Suggest new agents if session patterns warrant it.

Focus on actionable improvements with exact proposed text, not vague suggestions.
